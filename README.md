# Train-Scheduler
Creating an application that mimics a train schedule.  Using Firebase and Moment.js this website provides "up-to-date" information about trains and arrival times.
When someone adds any information to the form and hits the submit button the information is pushed to the Firebase server.  Then it is retrieved and converted and pulled back into the table.
